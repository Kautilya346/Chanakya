**What is photosynthesis?**

Photosynthesis is the process used by green plants to synthesize (prepare) their own food. The name is derived from "Photo" meaning light and "synthesis" meaning to combine (Source 1 - Class_7, Science, gesc101, Page 2).

**Key aspects of photosynthesis described in the excerpts:**

*   **Process:** During photosynthesis, the chlorophyll-containing cells of leaves use carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight to synthesize carbohydrates and release oxygen (Source 2 - Class_7, Science, gesc101, Page 3).
*   **Essential Requirements:** The necessary components for photosynthesis are chlorophyll, sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water (Source 1 - Class_7, Science, gesc101, Page 2; Source 3 - Class_7, Science, gesc101, Page 8).
*   **Location:** The process primarily takes place in the leaves, which contain the green pigment chlorophyll. Carbon dioxide is taken from the air through tiny pores on the leaf surface called stomata (Source 1 - Class_7, Science, gesc101, Page 2). Photosynthesis can also occur in other green parts of the plant, such as green stems and branches (Source 2 - Class_7, Science, gesc101, Page 3).
*   **Products:** The products of photosynthesis are complex chemical substances like carbohydrates (which are ultimately converted to and stored as starch) and oxygen (Source 2 - Class_7, Science, gesc101, Page 3; Source 3 - Class_7, Science, gesc101, Page 8).
*   **Equation:** The process can be represented by the equation:
    Carbon dioxide + water --(in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll)--> Carbohydrate + oxygen (Source 2 - Class_7, Science, gesc101, Page 3).
*   **Importance:** Photosynthesis is a unique and vital process on Earth. The survival of almost all living organisms depends directly or indirectly on the food made by plants. Furthermore, the oxygen released during photosynthesis is essential for the survival of all living organisms (Source 1 - Class_7, Science, gesc101, Page 2).
